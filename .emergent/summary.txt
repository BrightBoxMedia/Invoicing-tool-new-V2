The AI engineer's work involved an iterative process driven by user feedback and numerous deployment challenges. Initially, the engineer focused on addressing critical user issues: a recurring over-quantity invoicing bug and the request to unify regular and enhanced invoice creation systems. Although the AI engineer claimed early success, the quantity validation issue persisted, leading to user frustration. A new feature for logo upload via file was also implemented.

The trajectory then heavily shifted to resolving persistent deployment failures on Vercel and Firebase. This involved multiple attempts to optimize backend dependencies (to reduce function size), correct Vercel configuration conflicts ( vs. ), fix malformed HTML in the frontend , and address ESLint compilation errors ( function usage). Each deployment attempt led to new configurations, scripts, and temporary workarounds, many of which were later rolled back.

Ultimately, due to continuous deployment problems, the user requested a full rollback to the pre-deployment local working state. The current task is to prepare a guide for AWS deployment, suggesting a new phase of production-readiness efforts. The process highlighted the complexity of deployment and the importance of robust validation and clear configuration in a multi-environment context.

<product_requirements>
The objective is to build an enterprise-grade web-based invoice and project management tool, similar to Refrens.com's UI/UX, incorporating Activus Design & Build's branding. It must facilitate BOQ upload, project tracking, and GST-compliant invoice generation, including complex partial billing. Core features include multi-role user management, intelligent Excel BOQ upload, Performa/Tax invoice creation with RA1/RA2+ GST logic, dynamic PDF generation, advance received tracking, Item Master, Smart Filters/Search, Reports, Bank Guarantee scaffolding, and a PDF Text Extraction Engine.

Recent critical enhancements and fixes included:
1.  **Unified Invoice Creation**: Consolidating normal and enhanced invoice flows into one system.
2.  **Hard-Blocking Quantity Validation**: Preventing over-quantity invoicing with real-time client-side validation, visual highlighting, and robust backend checks.
3.  **UI/UX Improvements**: Removing input spinner arrows and ensuring invoices display correctly.
4.  **Logo Upload**: Implementing a Super Admin interface for direct file upload of company logos for invoice customization, replacing URL input.
5.  **Deployment**: Enabling seamless deployment to GitHub, Vercel, Firebase, and now AWS.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Architecture**: React.js (Frontend), FastAPI (Backend), MongoDB (Database).
-   **Data Processing**: OpenPyXL (Excel), ReportLab (PDF generation).
-   **Authentication**: Bcrypt, JWT.
-   **UI/UX**: Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, React Router.
-   **Deployment**: Kubernetes, Supervisor (local), Vercel, Firebase, AWS.
-   **Environment Management**:  files, production configurations.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database, designed for enterprise invoice and project management.

**Directory Structure:**



-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Core API and business logic.
    -   **Changes Made**: Quantity validation for invoice items was significantly enhanced to prevent over-billing, including improvements to 's description matching. Implemented a  endpoint for base64 image uploads. Integrated health check endpoints (, ) and security middleware.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Main application component, handling routing and core UI.
    -   **Changes Made**: Implemented client-side, hard-blocking quantity validation with visual error feedback and button disabling. Reverted  to  for local development. Integrated  and  for centralized settings. Removed 'Enhanced Invoice Creation' routing.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Python dependencies.
    -   **Changes Made**: Restored to the full set of dependencies required for local development, including PDF processing libraries, after Vercel optimization attempts.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Navigation menu.
    -   **Changes Made**: Removed entry for 'Enhanced Invoice Creation'.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: UI for customizing invoice appearance.
    -   **Changes Made**: Replaced  input with a file upload mechanism to handle and display base64 encoded logos.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Main HTML file.
    -   **Changes Made**: Removed Emergent branding. Fixed malformed HTML previously causing build issues. Updated title and description for professional branding.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Frontend dependencies and scripts.
    -   **Changes Made**: Dependencies adjusted and ESLint was temporarily disabled for deployment, then restored to a state suitable for local development.
-   ** (New)**:
    -   **Importance**: Provides instructions for local setup.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created as part of the rollback to guide local development.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully performed a complete rollback of the application. This action reversed all changes made during the numerous, unsuccessful attempts to deploy the application to Vercel and Firebase.

The current state of the product is now configured for local development:
1.  **Backend Configuration**: The  file has been restored to its local working configuration, including the direct execution of the FastAPI application using  when run as a script. This removes any Vercel-specific serverless function exports or Firebase function configurations.
2.  **Frontend URL**: The  file and the  component now correctly point  to , ensuring the frontend can communicate with the locally running backend.
3.  **Core Functionality**: The quantity validation for invoice items (both client-side in  and server-side in ), and the logo upload functionality ( and ), are implemented and presumed to be working correctly in this local environment.
4.  **Cleanup**: All deployment-specific files (e.g., , , various deployment scripts, environment templates, and documentation) created during the Vercel and Firebase efforts have been removed, cleaning the codebase for local development.
5.  **Service Status**: The , , and  services are confirmed to be running locally via backend                          RUNNING   pid 27, uptime 0:00:07
